INTRODUCTION
============

The purpose of this server is to run as a Jupyter Notebook server in the
context of a teaching event. IS IS PARAMOUNT THAT NO CONFIDENTIAL OR PRIVATE
INFORMATION IS STORED ON THE SERVER AS THE CONFIGURATION IS NOTE SAFE.


SECURITY WARNING
================

This server is configured as a Jupyter Notebook server that can be accessed
via the Internet. NOTE THAT THIS IS A SECURITY RISK AS JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
ALLOWS TO RUN A SHELL LOCALLY WHICH MIGHT ALLOW AN ATTACKER TO TAKE OVER THE
SERVER.  The Jupyter Notebook will be protected by a password. HOWEVER THIS
PASSWORD IS THE SAME FOR ALL USERS, AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SEE AND
INTERFERE WITH EACH OTHERS WORK.


SECURITY BEST PRACTICES
=======================

Therefore please follow those security best practices

- For every event a new server should be built from scratch; alternatively
  a clean image can be saved and a server can be rebuilt from that clean
  image. AN IMAGE FROM A SERVER USED IN AN EVENT CAN NOT BE CONSIDERED
  CLEAN.

- The server should be accessed via https in order to ensure that the
  password and/or the cookies are safe; note that the https server is
  usually running on a snakeoil certificate, so browsers will consider the
  connection unsafe even though it is not.

- The server should only be spun up for the duration of the event. During
  periods where the students do not need it the server should be taken down,
  either by executing the `off` command or by pausing the entire server.

- The server should not be used for private and/or confidential data; the
  exception to this is a single trusted user environment if a strong
  password is used and the server is accessed via https.


QUICK START INSTRUCTIONS
========================

All command are in `/root`. See next section for details.

- run `password` and choose a password for the server
- run `on` to launch the server
- the server will be running on https://*:8443 (1)
- the server can taken down running `off`

(1) the browser will throw security warnings because the certificate is not
valid; this is to be expected and not a problem within the general threat
model of an installation used in a training context without sensitive data


KEY COMMANDS PROVIDED
=====================

The following command scripts are provided in `root`:

- `password`: sets the server password
- `on`: launches the https server on *:8443 as background process
- `on_unsafe`: ditto, but the http server on *:8080 (2)
- `off`: takes the server down (either http or https)
- `runjupyter`: like on, but in the foreground (kill with ctrl-c)
- `runjupyter_unsafe`: ditto, but for on_unsafe
- `clean_jupyter_config`: resets Jupyter config, including password

(2) by default, all `unsafe` commans are disabled; in order to enable them
the file /home/jupyter/runjupyter_unsafe must be made executable

    chmod +x /home/jupyter/runjupyter_unsafe
